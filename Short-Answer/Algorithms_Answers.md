#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)The running time will be O(n^3). This is because it will be faster while n is small but will increase in time as n gets bigger since the while loop will run until a > n^3.



b)The running time will be O(log n) because j will double with each pass, multiplying itself by 2 on each pass.


c)The running time will be O(n) because recursion will loop.

## Exercise II

n = floor

I will loop through the upper floors until an egg is broken, then return the floor -1 to get the floor where the eggs are safe. The runtime complexity will be O(n).
